                        Honestly, it depends on your time management. However, we'd like to share that the instructor
                        managed to do it during their college years. Most colleges don't teach enough Web Development
                        for placements and internships, so there's more to learn beyond what is typically offered.

                        making the request is the consumer
                        about whom we have collected
