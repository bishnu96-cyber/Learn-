                        <i>Excessive Requests:</i> If
                        requests from a User are
                        manifestly unfounded or excessive,
                        in particular because of their
                        repetitive character, we may
                        either (1) charge a reasonable
                        fee, or (2) refuse to act on the
                        request and notify the User of the
                        reason for refusing the request.
                        If we charge a fee, the amount
                        will be based upon the
                        administrative costs of providing
                        the information or communication
                        or taking the action requested.
